# Plots with ggplot2

We are going to make plots in R and it's going to be amazing.

"We use the following data from the Santa Barbara Coastal Term Ecological Research and National  Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in our analyses"

```{r attach-libraries}
library(tidyverse)

library(readxl)

library(here)
```


```{r open-csv}

ca_np<-read.csv(here("data","ca_np.csv"))

head(ca_np)
summary(ca_np)


```


```{r open-excel}

ci_np <- read_excel(here("data", "ci_np.xlsx"))


```


```{r ggplot2}

ggplot(data = ci_np, aes(x = year, y = visitors)) +  geom_line()


gg_base<-ggplot(data = ci_np, aes(x = year, y = visitors)) 
#this above is indeed quite nice. you store in a variable just the data, 
#x and y information and then "map it" to a plot type (see below)

gg_base+geom_point()

gg_base+geom_col()


gg_base +
  geom_line(
    color = "purple",
    linetype = "dashed"
  )

```

``` {r conditional-plot}

gg_base + 
  geom_point(
    aes(size = visitors,
        color = visitors),
    alpha = 0.5
  )

gg_base + 
  geom_col(aes(fill = visitors))
```
